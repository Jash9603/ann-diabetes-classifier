# ann-diabetes-classifier
A deep learning project using a Sequential Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict diabetes based on health parameters from the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. The model is optimized using Keras Tuner (Random Search) for selecting the best hyperparameters such as number of layers, units per layer, dropout rates, and learning rate.
